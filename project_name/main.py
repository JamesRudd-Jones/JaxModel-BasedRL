# TODO focus on getting PETS to work

# TODO add in the learnt reward function as well

# TODO if we want to pretend we have no existing data how would this work? This may be a struggle with Jax so need to
# TODO figure the best approach

# TODO sort out all the right shapes, so we don't have to arbitrarily squeeze and add dims in MPC, also can we avoid postmean_func2

# TODO replace the updating dataset with flashbax maybe? would this be more efficient or less?

# env, env_params = gymnax.make("MountainCarContinuous-v0")
# TODO make these envs in gymnax style for continuous control, can we add a wrapper so we don't need to add generative env to them all?


"""
To check all this
curr_obs is the current obs of the environment
x_next is these obs appended with some action
nobs comes from passing x_next into the simulator
y_next = nobs - curr_obs
update_obs_fn literally just adds curr_obs + y_next to get the true nobs, and adds some teleportation if needed
